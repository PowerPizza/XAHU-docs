# Whatsapp-Image-Popper

As you may know, when you paste a website or image link into the message box on WhatsApp, it often generates a preview above the text area. This preview typically includes the site’s logo or a thumbnail image. When you send the message, the preview is sent along with it and remains visible in the chat. For example, try sending https://youtube.com in WhatsApp—you’ll see that YouTube’s logo appears as a preview.  
<div style="display: flex; gap: 3px">
<img src="img_whatsapp_preview2.jpeg" alt="Popup Example" width="200" height="300">
<img src="img_whatsapp_preview1.jpeg" alt="Popup Example" width="200" height="300">
</div>

The tool **WhatsApp-Image-Popper** allows you to generate a custom image preview in WhatsApp, just like the previews shown when sharing links. To do this, the image you want to display must first be added to the tool’s database through its dashboard. We’ll cover how to add images in a later section. 

# How it works ?
On this tool, users first create an account and upload images to their personal dashboard. Once the images are uploaded, they can use specific link patterns (explained below) in their WhatsApp chats to load and preview the images they've uploaded through the tool’s dashboard.  
When users upload images to this tool, the entries are saved under their account but can be accessed by anyone using the correct link patterns (explained below). This means that anyone with the right link can trigger that image to pop up in their WhatsApp chats as well. In essence, every image upload contributes to a shared database that powers image popups.  
Since multiple users can upload images with the same name, I’ve introduced endpoints (also explained below) to differentiate between users. Each endpoint uniquely identifies the uploader, ensuring the correct image is loaded even if the name is the same.


# How to use only ?
Go to https://wipr.onrender.com, where you’ll see a collection of images along with their names and endpoints. Browse through the available images, and once you’ve found the one you want to send, return to WhatsApp and open the chat where you want to share the image.  
<img src="site_homepage_view.png" alt="Kind of webpage you will see.">  
Now type the link pattern given below in the chat.  

## Link Patterns
These link patterns are designed to be copy-pasted directly or typed manually into WhatsApp, allowing you to load and preview your desired image through WhatsApp’s link preview feature.
1. > https://wipr.onrender.com/use/ENDPOINT_NAME/IMAGE_NAME

2. > https://wipr.onrender.com/use/IMAGE_NAME
   
>> **Note:** Make sure to replace `ENDPOINT_NAME` with the actual endpoint you copied from the website, and `IMAGE_NAME` with the exact name of the image you want to send.

## Significance of Links With and Without Endpoints
In *Pattern 1*, we use the format `ENDPOINT_NAME/IMAGE_NAME`. This ensures that the exact image is loaded, even if different users have uploaded images with the same name. Each endpoint uniquely identifies a user, so using a specific endpoint guarantees that the image previewed in WhatsApp is the one uploaded by that particular user.

However, in *Pattern 2*, where the link does not include an `ENDPOINT`, the tool simply searches for the image by name. If only one image exists with that name, it will be loaded. But if multiple users have uploaded images with the same name, the tool may select and preview any one of them at random in WhatsApp.

# How to Add and Use Custom Images with This Tool ?
## STEP 1: Create an account on [wipr](https://wipr.onrender.com/)

# Emoji Update
With this update, you can now use the tool to popup emojis directly in WhatsApp.  
To use this feature, simply use the following URL format in WhatsApp:
https://wipr.onrender.com/emoji/AN_EMOJI

Replace `AN_EMOJI` with any emoji or single character such as `1`, `2`, `3`, `A`, `B`, `C`, etc., to make it pop up in WhatsApp.

**Note:** 
* Not all emojis are currently supported, but most popular ones have been included.
* Text characters like 1, A, or C are supported, but they might not appear perfectly centered in the popup image.
* Make sure to use only one character or emoji at a time. If you use more than one, only the first character will be shown in the popup.
### Example :-
using `https://wipr.onrender.com/emoji/😋` to popup `😋` emoji.  
<img src="popup_emoji_exmp1.jpeg" alt="Popup Example" width="200" height="300">
<img src="popup_emoji_exmp2.jpeg" alt="Popup Example" width="200" height="300">

# Itag Update
The **Itag (Image Tag)** feature allows you to send **name-tagged** images directly on WhatsApp.  
*For example,* imagine you type a command like: `user1_slap_user2`  
Here, **user1** and **user2** can be the names of any two people. The tool will automatically generate an image of an anime character slapping another character, with **user1** and **user2** tagged in the image according to the command format.  
When you press Send in WhatsApp, this tagged image will be sent to the recipient instantly.  
In short, the Itag feature makes it possible to create and send fun, personalized images with custom name tags in seconds.  
To use it :-
* Open anyone's chat in whatsapp
* Copy-paste or manually type `https://wipr.onrender.com/itag/user1_action_user2`
* Carefully replace suffix of url `user1_action_user2` with correct placeholders
  * user1 : name of person who is performing the action.
  * action : any valid action of [itag action list](https://wipr.onrender.com/list_itags)
  * user2 : name of the person who is going to be affected due to action.  
  **For example :**  if scihack want to show a popup in WhatsApp where scihack is slapping powerpizza so the suffix of url will be *scihack_slap_powerpizza*


* Here's how it looks like when used in WhatsApp
<img src="itag_example.png" alt="Kind of webpage you will see."> 

* **Note :** If you would like to add your own images with custom tags then you have to understood how this feature works which will be explained later, for now only the admin of this tool can add custom command and images.
# More Info <span style="color: cyan">ⓘ</span>
* You can upload a maximum of 70 images per account. This limit is in place due to database storage constraints.
* GIF files are not supported. Since WhatsApp link previews do not support GIFs, this tool cannot display them either.
* We generally recommend using the second link pattern, as it is shorter and easier to type in chats. However, if you know the specific endpoint that contains the image you want, you can use the first link pattern for more accuracy.
* Only image links can be added to the tool at the moment. Direct file uploads are not supported yet, but this feature may be added in the future.

# For Android 📱
* WhatsApp Image Popper is now available as android app. [Install Now](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zbVkNiUOFrPP0G9kYeuI3HfGtV25Fy3D?usp=drive_link)

# Cautions ⚠️
* Do not share your username or password. If someone gains access, they can upload images to your account without your permission.
* Avoid uploading video links, GIFs, or unsupported media formats. These are not compatible and will not work with the tool.
* Ensure the image resolution is at least 300×168 pixels. Lower-resolution images may still appear, but they will show up very small in the WhatsApp preview popup.
* Do not link personal or sensitive images. All uploaded images become part of a public database, meaning anyone with the link can access and use them.
